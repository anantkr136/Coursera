<br><br>

This is my first post as part of my IBM Professional Data Science Certification. This project involving the Foursquare API and various data tools such as wikipedia etc. The project allowed me to pull together many of the tools\libraries I learned in the course:

<br>
<ul>
<li> <font size=3>Jupyter notebook</font></li>
<li> <font size=3>pandas</font></li>
<li> <font size=3>folium</font></li>
<li> <font size=3>json</font></li>
<li> <font size=3>requests</font></li>
<li> <font size=3>bs4</font></li>
</ul>

<H3>Problem Statement</H3>
Indians are more welcoming now a days to drink in public rather than in their hideouts or home. Drinking is becoming norm at social gatherings. India has population of 1.3Billion people but still not enough bars to cater such a large customer base.
Finding the right place to open any restaurent and bar is always the key to business.
I am trying to build a model to forecast best locality to open the next bar in Mumbai(India).

<h3> Data set sources </h3>
<br> I have collected locality data from <b><u>wikipedia </u></b>and then used <b><u>foursquare apis</u></b> to collect venue details.
